title: Y7K Constitution
---

Y7K is a digital agency started by Joris Noordermeer, Yves Sinka and Ruben Feurer. It origins from the desire to work on something that creates value for their clients as well as society, and is in line with their inner conviction.

The following constitution forms the fundament on which the organisation is based. Its articles define a set of principles and moral beliefs we want to live and work by on a daily basis. Individuals who work at Y7K agree with this constitution and act on the best of their knowledge and belief to follow the principles. It aims to give members of the organisation a maximal amount of liberty and independence in their work life and will provide a measurement for actions. 

To implement the constitution in our daily business, we define a set of rules, measurable goals and concrete actions. 

An organisation needs to adapt to its integral parts and outside environment. Therefore the constitution, as the backbone of our organisation, is fluid. The people of Y7K regularly improve the constitution by means of adjusting its content.
