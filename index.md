Welcome to the future of politics!

You're probably here because you've decided to join [Something New](https://somethingnew.org.uk) and you've been told this is the place to go. It is. It's full of useful information about being a member of our little political party.

This site is a collaborative effort, built with software from the [OpenPolitics project](https://openpolitics.org.uk). It's a bit like a wiki, but with voting.

* Anyone can edit a page - just click "suggest a change" in the top right.
* Once a suggestion is made, other contributors vote on whether or not it's accepted. Click "View proposals" above to see the current proposals.
* Once a proposal is accepted, the author gets to vote on future proposals.

For now, while you can edit any page, new pages must be created using GitHub's built-in editor or by using a local git clone. Talk to a project administrator or a nearby coder for help there.

Let's get started;

* [Communication](communication.html) - Learn how communication works here.
